Each line of the header section of the email was scanned and split by the colon character based on the RFC
specification for email layouts

Any text before the colon is seen as the header key that follows the colon is seen
as the header value

The headers (with descriptions) that were found in the complete set of emails were:
- Received1 (fabricated header)

-Received2 (fabricated header)
